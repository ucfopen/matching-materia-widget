    Each item in the inner items array represents a matching pair. The text in the questions property represents one half of the pair,
    and the text in the answers property represents the other half. Every item representing a matched pair contains an assets property,
    which should always contain an array with 3 index positions: the first two should always be the integer 0, and the third should be a string
    containing a random integer.
